# Quantum-Health-Classifier
In this project, I built a quantum classifier using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not. I combined classical data preprocessing techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) with quantum circuits to explore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning.
